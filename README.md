# Pearson Correlation with Python



## Description



### What is Correlation?

Correlation means finding the relationship between variables. In data science, we use correlation to find features that are positively and negatively correlated with each other so that we can choose the best features to train a machine learning model.

The degree of correlation is between -1 and 1. When the value of the correlation between the features is 1, then those features are positively correlated with each other, and when the value of the correlation between the features is -1, it means that those features are negatively correlated to each other.

When the value of the correlation between the features is equal to 0, we can say that there is no correlation between the features. In machine learning, we can use correlation to check the relationship between all the features regarding the target label. So we can select those features to train the machine learning model which are highly correlated to the target label.

Pearson correlation is a statistical technique for measuring the degree of the linear relationship between two or more features. Demand and supply are the best examples of understanding of Pearsonâ€™s correlation. For example, the supply of a product will increase when the demand for the product increases, and the supply of the product will decrease when the demand for that product increases.
